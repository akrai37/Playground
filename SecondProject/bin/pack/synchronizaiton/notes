Synchronization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a process to control multiple threads and launch them one by one.


Three ways to achieve synchronization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Method Level synchronization
2.block or object level
3.static or class level synchronization


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
->If we want the currently executing thread to wait for some time, we use 'sleep()' method.
->if we want to communicate between different threads, we can use wait(),notify(),notifyall();.
