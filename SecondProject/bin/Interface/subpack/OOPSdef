
 1.When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program.

OOPS
----------------------------------

1.Inheritance
2.Abstraction
3.Encapsulation
4.Polymorphism

Inheritance:-
Inheriting one class into another which will allow us to inherit/use the methods and objects of parent class into subclass. 

Abstraction:-
1. Hiding the implementation and showing only the functionality to the user. It can be achieved through Interfaces and abstract classes.It is not necessary to show the implementation everytime to the user.
2. Ex-Phone call,ATM
 
Encapsulation:-
Hiding the data and coding together in the single unit. It is done by making the methods and variables 'private'. 
If you have to access the private elements indirectly, then we should use EITHER java bean OR Constructor.    
Java Bean:-
The java class which has 'getter' and 'setter' method.                        


Polymorphism:-
1.Many forms-Single function can do multiple actions.Ex:-
method overloading
method overiding

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Literals:-
The value assigned to a variable  is called literal.

int x=22;             Integer literal
float f=33.12;		  float literal	
char letter="a";      character literal
String name="rahul"   string literal


BigInteger:- 
It can used to store very large numbers. Example:-

import java.math.BigInteger;
public class User_encap {

	  public static void main(String[] args) {
	  
		 BigInteger bt1=new BigInteger("718561104453892");
		 BigInteger bt2=new BigInteger("392561338206385");
		 System.out.println(bt1.mod(bt2));    //It will give us the remainder
      }
}

enum:- It is like an object in JS where we put some values.Example:-


enum days {monday,tuesday,wednesday};

public class User_encap {

      public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			for(object o:days.values()){
			    System.out.println(o);     //It will print all the values in the enum 'days'.
			}
      }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeConversions:- 
Java supports both narrowing and widening type conversions.        

Widening Casting:- converting a smaller type into larger type size.        byte->short->char->int->long->float->double
Narrowing Casting:- converting a larger type into smaller type size.       double->float->long->int->char->short->byte

A Definition of Java Garbage Collection
Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. 
Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap,
which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.
It is an automatic process done by garbage collector of JVM. Programmer doesn't have to do anything in this.
